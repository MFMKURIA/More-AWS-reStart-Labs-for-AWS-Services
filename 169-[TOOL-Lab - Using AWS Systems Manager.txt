1. Access Run Command:
    - In the Systems Manager console, for Node Management, select Run Command.

2. Choose a Command Document:
    - Choose Run command.
    - Use the search icon to locate the appropriate command document.
    - Select the document for Install Dashboard App.

3. Configure the Command:
    - Leave the Document version option set to default.
    - For Target selection, select Choose instances manually.
    - In the Instances section, select Managed Instance.
    - In the Output options section, clear Enable an S3 bucket.
    - Expand the AWS CLI command section to view the command.

4. Run the Command:
    - Choose Run.
    - A banner with a Command ID should appear indicating the command was successfully sent.
    - After 1-2 minutes, the Overall status should change to Success.

5. Validate Installation:
    - In the Vocareum console, go to the Details dropdown list and choose Show.
    - Copy the ServerIP value.
    - Open a new browser tab, paste the IP address, and press Enter to view the installed application.

Explanation: This task illustrates using Run Command to remotely install applications on your instances without needing direct SSH access, enhancing security and efficiency.

 Task 3: Use Parameter Store to Manage Application Settings

Objective: Use Parameter Store to store and manage application configuration data.

1. Access Parameter Store:
    - In the Systems Manager console, under Application Management, select Parameter Store.

2. Create a Parameter:
    - Choose Create parameter.
    - For Name, enter `/dashboard/show-beta-features`.
    - For Description, enter `Display beta features`.
    - Leave Tier and Type as default.
    - For Value, enter `True`.
    - Choose Create parameter.

3. Verify the Parameter:
    - Return to the web browser tab with the application and refresh the page.
    - Observe that additional beta features are now displayed in the application.

Explanation: Parameter Store provides a secure way to manage configuration data and secrets, allowing applications to dynamically retrieve settings without hardcoding values.

 Task 4: Use Session Manager to Access Instances

Objective: Access EC2 instances securely using Session Manager.

1. Access Session Manager:
    - In the Systems Manager console, under Node Management, select Session Manager.

2. Start a Session:
    - Choose Start session.
    - Select Managed Instance.
    - Choose Start session.

3. Run Commands in the Session:
    - In the session window, run `ls /var/www/html` to list the application files.
    - To get region details, run:
      ```bash
      AZ=`curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone`
      export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${AZ::-1}
      ```
    - To list EC2 instance details, run:
      ```bash
      aws ec2 describe-instances
      ```

Explanation: Session Manager allows secure and auditable instance management without the need for SSH, making it a robust solution for compliance and security.
