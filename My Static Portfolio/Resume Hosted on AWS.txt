To create and deploy this static resume site, the following AWS services and resources were used:

1. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
   - Purpose: Store and serve static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).
   - Configuration: S3 bucket configured for public access and static website hosting.

2. Amazon CloudFront:
   - Purpose: Distribute content globally with low latency and high transfer speeds using AWS's CDN.
   - Configuration: CloudFront distribution pointing to the S3 bucket, with caching and security settings optimized.

3. Amazon Route 53:
   - Purpose: Manage DNS to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
   - Configuration: DNS records (e.g., A, CNAME) pointing the domain to the CloudFront distribution.

4. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):
   - Purpose: Provision and manage SSL/TLS certificates for securing the website with HTTPS.
   - Configuration: Certificate requested for the domain and associated with the CloudFront distribution for HTTPS.

5. IAM (Identity and Access Management):
   - Purpose: Manage permissions and roles to control access to AWS resources.
   - Configuration: IAM roles and policies to grant necessary permissions for accessing S3 buckets, CloudFront, and other resources.
